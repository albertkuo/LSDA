    "Let's look at this pair, (7, 48). Article 7 is about a competitive swimmer and article 48 is about a Japanese bank. One common topic may be that certain Japanese locations are mentioned in article 7 as places where the swimmer had competed. Also, the consistent mentioning of \"gold\" and \"silver\" medals may seem like a finance topic, which the Japanese bank article likely has as well."

He is a three-time Olympian and seven-time Olympic medalist (five gold, two silver).  As a member of the U.S. national team, he holds the world record in the men's 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay (long course).  Individually, he currently holds the world record in the 100-meter and 200-meter backstroke events (long course).  In February 2011, Peirsol announced his retirement, saying, &quot;I ended up doing everything I set out to do.&quot;   Peirsol's successes have earned him the American Swimmer of the Year Award once.  He has won a total of thirty-six medals in major international competition, twenty-nine gold, six silver, and one bronze spanning the Olympics, the World, Pan American, and the Pan Pacific Championships.  In his Olympic debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics, at the age of 17, Peirsol won a silver medal in the 200-meter backstroke.  Four years later, at the 2004 Summer Olympics, Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter and 200-meter backstroke (sweeping the backstroke events) and the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay.  In his third Olympics (2008 Summer Olympics), Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay.  He came short of his success he had in Athens by winning silver in the 200-meter backstroke, finishing behind Ryan Lochte.  ==Personal life==  Peirsol was born in Irvine, California in 1983, the son of Scott and Wella Peirsol.  His father is a captain and his mother is a retired dental hygenist.   He has one younger sister, Hayley, who is also a swimmer.  Peirsol and his sister are the only sibling duo to medal at the same FINA World Championships (in 2003).   He is a 2002 graduate of Newport Harbor High School in Newport Beach, California.  Peirsol attended the University of Texas at Austin and graduated in 2006, majoring in government.  He was the 2003 NCAA Swimmer of the Year. After finishing his second year of collegiate eligibility, Peirsol signed with Nike, Inc., thus turning professional. Peirsol trained under the guidance of Eddie Reese and Kris Kubik.  Peirsol is also involved in a number of charities.  He is an ambassador for the Global Water Foundation and the Surfrider Foundation. He is also a spokesman for Oceana, which is the largest international ocean conservation and advocacy organization.  ==Swimming career== ===2000-2002===  Peirsol qualified for his first Olympics at the age of seventeen after finishing second to Lenny Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. Peirsol also competed in the 100-meter backstroke, but did not qualify for the event, finishing 4th. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Peirsol finished second to Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke. Afterwards Peirsol said, &quot;I think I'm getting to a point where I'm becoming more of a threat to (Lenny) and I think he knows that.&quot;   At the 2001 National Championships, with Krayzelburg not competing, Peirsol qualified for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka in the 100-meter backstroke, the 200-meter backstroke, and the 4x100-meter medley relay.  Peirsol's time in the 200-meter backstroke was the second-fastest ever, with only Krayzelburg's world record faster. At the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won gold in the 200-meter backstroke with a time of 1:57.13, a championship record.   Peirsol started off 2002 with the first world record of his career in the 200-meter backstroke, bettering Krayzelburg's mark set in 1999. In his first major competition of 2002, Peirsol won five medals (three gold, one silver, one bronze) at the 2002 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Moscow.  In Moscow, he was a part of the American team that broke the world record in the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay and he broke the 200-meter backstroke world record. At the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay.  Combined with Brendan Hansen, Michael Phelps, and Jason Lezak, Peirsol set the world record in the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay to break the previous record set in 2000.  ===2003 World Championships===  At the 2003 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay.  He also won a silver medal in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay.  In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a time of 53.61, a championship record.  His time was just 0.01&amp;nbsp;s off Lenny Krayzelburg's world record. Peirsol participated in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay with Michael Phelps, Nate Dusing, and Klete Keller to win silver behind Australia. Peirsol then competed in the 200-meter backstroke and won gold in a time of 1:55.92, almost two seconds ahead of second-place finisher Gordan Ko\\u017eulj of Croatia. Peirsol also competed in the 50-meter backstroke and the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay.  In the 50-meter backstroke, Peirsol finished out of medal contention with a 8th place finish. In his last event, Peirsol competed in the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak.  The final time of 3:31.54 was a new world record, bettering the old mark from 2002.  ===2004 Summer Olympic Games=== ''''  At the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke.  Four years after finishing in 4th place at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Peirsol won the 100-meter backstroke title, beating Lenny Krayzelburg. Peirsol was the only individual in the field to break 54 seconds and was just off Krayzelburg's world record. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in a world record time of 1:54.74, bettering his previous record of 1:55.15 set in 2002. He beat his closest competitor, Michael Phelps, by more than a second.  At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke, sweeping the backstroke events, and the 4x100-meter medley relay.  In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a time of 54.06, 0.29&amp;nbsp;s ahead of second-place finisher Markus Rogan of Austria. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in an Olympic record time of 1:54.95 and completed a clean sweep of the backstroke events. Rogan again finished second to Peirsol, 2.40&amp;nbsp;s back.  An initial disqualification alleged that Peirsol had made an illegal turn during the 200-meter backstroke race. Having been improperly entered, the disqualification was eventually overturned. In his last event, the 4x100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a world record time of 3:30.68, 2.94&amp;nbsp;s ahead of second-place finisher Germany. While leading off the relay, Peirsol broke the world record in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 53.45, bettering Krayzelburg's time of 53.60 set in 1999.  Peirsol caused minor controversy when he accused Kosuke Kitajima of Japan of using an illegal dolphin kick in the 100-meter breaststroke final when compatriot Brendan Hansen lost by 0.17&amp;nbsp;s.  ===2004 FINA Short Course World Championships===  Shortly after the 2004 Summer Olympics, Peirsol then competed at the 2004 FINA Short Course World Championships in Indianapolis where he won three gold medals.  His first gold medal came in the 100-meter backstroke in a time of 50.72, a new championship record. Three days later, Peirsol competed in the 200-meter backstroke and the 4x100-meter medley relay.  In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a world record time of 1:50.52, bettering his old mark of 1:50.64 (set earlier in 2004) and finished 2.02&amp;nbsp;s ahead of Matt Welsh of Australia. Peirsol then competed in the 4x100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a world record time of 3:25.09, 4.63&amp;nbsp;s ahead of Australia. Peirsol also competed in the 50-meter backstroke but finished out of medal contention.  ===2005 World Championships===  At the 2005 World Championship Trials, the selection meet for the 2005 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke.  In the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won and broke his own world record with a time of 53.17, bettering his time of 53.45 set in Athens. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol easily won with a time of 1:55.13.  At the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay.  In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a time of 53.62, just 0.01&amp;nbsp;s off his championship record set two years earlier in Barcelona. For his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in dominating fashion.  His time of 1:54.66 was a new world record and 1.97&amp;nbsp;s ahead of second-place finisher Markus Rogan. Peirsol then competed in the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a time of 3:31.85, 3.23&amp;nbsp;s ahead of second-place finisher Russia. Peirsol also competed in the 50-meter backstroke but finished out of medal contention.  ===2006 Pan Pacific Championships===  At the 2006 National Championships, the selection meet for the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships and the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke.  At the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay.  In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a championship record time of 53.32. Peirsol was the only individual in the field to break 54 seconds and beat his closest competitor, Ryan Lochte, by 0.70&amp;nbsp;s. Peirsol earned his second gold in the 200-meter backstroke with a world record time of 1:54.44, bettering his previous mark of 1:54.66 set last year in Montreal. At the time, Peirsol held nine of the fastest times posted in the event and defeated second-place finisher Michael Phelps by 2.37&amp;nbsp;s. Peirsol then competed in the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a time of 3:31.79, a new championship record.  ===2007 World Championships===  At the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne, Peirsol won one gold and one silver medal.  In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a world record time of 52.98, bettering his time of 53.17 set in 2005. Peirsol became the first man in the event to go under 53 seconds and beat Ryan Lochte by 0.52&amp;nbsp;s.  At the time, Peirsol held five of the fastest times posted in the event.  At one point during the first 50-meters, Peirsol was a full meter behind Ryan Lochte, and at the turn, Peirsol was in third place behind Liam Tancock and Lochte.  But Peirsol had a superior finish to over-take both swimmers. After the race, Peirsol thanked Lochte for the fast start, which he attributed to the world record. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Lochte and lost his world record he set in 2006. Throughout the race, Peirsol was in first and at the 150-meter mark, Peirsol was ahead of Lochte 1:24.56 to 1:25.05.  But Lochte had a strong finish to over-take Peirsol for the win. For Peirsol, it was his first international loss in the event since the 2000 Summer Olympics. Peirsol did not have a chance to swim in the 4\\xd7100-meter medley relay final because the United States was disqualified in the heats.  ===2008 Summer Olympic Games=== ''''  At the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke, repeating his results from the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials.  In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won ahead of Matt Grevers with a world record time of 52.89, lowering his previous mark of 52.98 set last year. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in a time of 1:54.32, equalling Ryan Lochte's world record set last year. Lochte finished a close second, just 0.02&amp;nbsp;s behind Peirsol.  At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4x100-meter medley relay.  He also won silver in the 200-meter backstroke.  In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol was the heavy favorite for gold, with him being the world-record holder and the defending Olympic champion.  For the final of the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol was swimming in lane two, having qualified fifth in the semifinals.  At the first 50-meters in the 100-meter backstroke final, Peirsol was in second place behind Liam Tancock, who took it out in 25.11.  Peirsol was 0.54&amp;nbsp;s behind Tancock at the turn.  However, after the turn, Peirsol overtook Tancock, who eventually placed sixth, and won the gold.  Peirsol's final time of 52.54 was a new world record, bettering his previous mark of 52.89 set last month.  After the race, Peirsol said, &quot;I'm a little bit excited, a little bit relieved, absolutely elated.&quot; In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Ryan Loche 1:54.33 to 1:53.94.  In winning the gold, Lochte broke the world record tie he and Peirsol shared in the 200-meter backstroke. In his last event, the 4x100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Brendan Hansen, Michael Phelps, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a world record time of 3:29.34, lowering the old mark of 3:30.68 set four years ago in Athens.  ===2009 World Championships=== Peirsol (right) after his victory in the 200&amp;nbsp;m backstroke at the 2009 National Championships. At the 2009 National Championships, the selection meet for the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke.  In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in a time of 51.94, reclaiming the world record from Aschwin Wildeboer Faber. In winning the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol became the first person to swim the event in under 52 seconds and it was the sixth time he set the world record in the event. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol defeated Ryan Lochte and reclaimed the 200-meter backstroke world record he lost in Beijing. Peirsol also competed in the 100-meter butterfly but did not qualify for the event in Rome, finishing in third place.  At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Peirsol won two gold medals.  In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol surprised many after he failed to make the final, which he attributed to a miscalculation of his own position in the semifinals.  Peirsol said, &quot;I thought I was going faster.  I am very disappointed. I completely misjudged my race. I have to go on, pick myself up and focus on my next events.&quot; But Peirsol's world record in the 100-meter backstroke would stay in place after the final. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won the gold in a time of 1:51.92, breaking his own world record of 1:53.08 by more than a second. Peirsol then competed in the 50-meter backstroke but did not advance past the heats. In his last event, the 4x100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Eric Shanteau, Michael Phelps, and David Walters to win gold in a world record time of 3:27.28, lowering the old mark of 3:29.34 set a year ago in Beijing. While leading off the relay, Peirsol broke the championship record in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 52.19, bettering the previous mark of 52.26 set by Junya Koga.  ===2010 Pan Pacific Championships===  At the 2010 National Championships, Peirsol placed second in both the 100 and 200-meter backstroke. In the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to David Plummer, who touched just 0.03&amp;nbsp;s ahead.  For Peirsol, it was his first loss in the 100-meter backstroke at a national championships since he placed 4th at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Ryan Lochte, who finished 0.70&amp;nbsp;s ahead.  At the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4x100-meter medley relay.  Peirsol's first gold came in the 100-meter backstroke.  Initially, Peirsol did not qualify to swim in the medal-awarding final because only a maximum of two swimmers from one country could enter in the finals and David Plummer and Ryan Lochte owned the top two American spots. However, Lochte withdrew from the 100-meter backstroke and as a result, Peirsol advanced to the finals.  Peirsol ended up winning the gold in a time of 53.31, breaking his own championship record set in 2006. Peirsol then competed in the 200-meter backstroke but did not qualify to swim in the medal-awarding final, with Lochte and Tyler Clary taking the top two American spots. In his final event, the 4x100-meter medley relay, Peirsol won gold along with compatriots Mark Gangloff, Michael Phelps, and Nathan Adrian.  This would be the last race of his international career.  When the competition was over, Peirsol said he put his swimming equipment in a locker and walked away.  ==Retirement==  On February 2, 2011, at the age of twenty-seven, Peirsol announced that he was officially retiring from professional swimming. This ended months of speculation after Peirsol withdrew from his spots in both the 2010 FINA Short Course World Championships in Dubai and the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai.  Peirsol said he contemplated retirement after the 2008 Summer Olympics.  In 2010, he said he had no further goals and found it difficult to swim because he &quot;ended up doing everything (he) set out to do.&quot;  He added, &quot;Things outside of the sport started to interest me.&quot; Peirsol said it was &quot;poetic&quot; that he ended his career at the same pool he trained as a kid at the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. Peirsol plans on going to graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin to study political science.  \""

As of November 2008 it was reported as being the world's biggest deposit holder. It is one of only two banks to have branches in every prefecture in Japan, the other being Mizuho Bank.  ==History==  Postal savings was introduced to Japan in 1875 and operated as a government department until privatization of the postal service was passed under the government of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.  The bank was established on 1 September 2006, as part of the reorganisation of Japan Post into Japan Post Holdings.  Prior to 2009, Japan Post was not connected to the Japanese Bankers Association (''Zenginkyo'') payment processing network, making it impossible to wire money directly between Japan Post and most other Japanese banks. Japan Post Bank joined the network in January 2009 and became a full JBA member in October 2011.  ==Products==  Unlike most commercial banks, Japan Post Bank is primarily a savings institution. Its only loan products are overdraft lines secured by time deposits and Japanese government bonds on deposit with the bank.  Japan Post Bank offers a nationwide ATM network which can be used to withdraw money with international bank cards and credit cards.  \""

Retrieved on December 7, 2009.  It holds assets of around US$2.5 trillion (JPY 230 trillion) as of March 2013[ and is one of the main companies of the Mitsubishi Group.[ About MUFG &gt; Company Overview : Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group] It is Japan's largest financial group and the world's second largest bank holding company holding around US$1.8 trillion (JPY 148 trillion) in deposits as of March 2011.  ==Background== The company was formed on October 1, 2005 with the merger of Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group (MTFG), formerly Japan's second-largest banking conglomerate, and Osaka-based UFJ Holdings, which was Japan's fourth-largest banking group.  The core banking units of the group, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UFJ Bank, were merged on January 1, 2006 to form The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. This integration was originally scheduled to take place on October 1, 2005, the same day that the parent companies were merged. However, pressure from Japan's Financial Services Agency, which wanted to ensure the smooth systems integration of the two banking giants, caused the merger of the banks to be postponed for three months. The trust banking and securities units of MTFG and UFJ were merged according to the original schedule on October 1, 2005.  ==History== The financial group dates back to 1880 as the Yokohama Specie Bank later renamed to The Bank Of Tokyo, Ltd. Also in 1880, The Mitsubishi Bank, Ltd. was founded by former samurai Yataro Iwasaki. In 1919, the Mitsubishi Bank financed the Mitsubishi ''zaibatsu'', most of which is today Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. In April 1996, The Mitsubishi Bank, Ltd. and The Bank of Tokyo, Ltd. merged.  In July 2004, Japan's fourth-largest financial group UFJ Holdings offered to merge with MTFG. The merger of the two bank holding companies was completed on October 1, 2005. UFJ was created from a merger with the Toyo Trust and Banking, a part of the Toyota Motor Corporation. Toyota's chairman sat on the board of the UFJ which became one of the world's largest money losing corporations. UFJ was accused by the government of corruption and making bad loans to the yakuza crime syndicates. The UFJ is one of the largest shareholders of Toyota. The trust banking and securities units of the two groups were merged on the same day. The core banking units of MTFG and UFJ, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. and UFJ Bank, respectively, continued to operate separately until January 1, 2006, when they were merged to form The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd..  In September 2008, MUFJ signed a letter of intent with Morgan Stanley to form an alliance and purchase 20% of the American firm.[ Press Release]. Morgan Stanley (2008-09-22). Retrieved on 2013-08-23.  In 2008 at the ''2008 ALB Japan Law Awards'', Mitsubishi UFJ was crowned: * In-House of the Year \\u2013 Japan Investment Bank In-House Team of the Year * Deal of the Year \\u2013 Debt Market Deal of the Year  In April 2011, UFJ and Morgan Stanley entered into an agreement to convert UFJ's outstanding convertible preferred stock in Morgan Stanley into Morgan Stanley stock.  ===Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group, Inc.===   was one of Japan's largest banks ranked by assets (an estimated US$1 trillion), second only to Mizuho Holdings. On October 1, 2005, MTFG completed the acquisition of UFJ Holdings, Japan's fourth largest banking group, to form the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the world's largest bank ranked by assets with \\xa5190 trillion (approximately $1.7 trillion).  MTFG was widely considered financially the strongest of Japan's large banks, with non-performing loans down to 2.9% of assets.  ===UFJ Holdings, Inc.===  was the weakest among the three major banking groups in Japan. &quot;UFJ&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;United Financial of Japan&quot;, was formed from a merger of  Sanwa Bank and Tokai Bank with the Toyo Trust &amp; Banking Co. Ltd, a part of the Toyota Motor Corporation. At the time, it was one of the largest shareholders of Toyota. The Chairman of Toyota was a director on its board during the financial scandals and indictments of three UFJ executives. The banking crisis led to its merger, after being one of the world's greatest losing corporations, on October 1, 2005, with the Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group to form the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.  Formed April 1, 2001, with the merger of Sanwa Bank, Tokai Bank, and Toyo Trust and Banking.  In July 2004, UFJ announced plans to merge with the Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group.  The merger was completed on October 1, 2005, creating the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the world's second biggest bank by assets at $1.7 trillion, trailing behind Citigroup with $2.4 trillion in assets.  In June 2011, UFJ took a 99.9 percent stake in Lynas Corp, the Australian rare earths developer, after buying an additional 10%.  ==Group Companies== (as of January 1, 2006)  * The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. * Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS Co., Ltd., a credit card issuer, formed through the merger of UFJ Card Co., Ltd., Nippon Shinpan Company Limited, UFJ Nicos Co., Ltd., DC Card Co., Ltd. and Kyodo Credit Service Co., Ltd. * Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation * Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Co., Ltd. * Mitsubishi UFJ Securities International plc, (UK) * Mitsubishi UFJ Information Technology * UnionBanCal Corporation, holding company of Union Bank of California * The Senshu Bank, Ltd. * UFJ Credit Co., Ltd. * Toyo Hosho Services Co., Ltd. * UFJ Strategic Partner Co., Ltd. * UFJ Equity Investments Co., Ltd. * UFJ Trust Equity Co., Ltd. * NBL Co., Ltd. * UFJ Business Finance Co., Ltd. * Toyo Trust Total Finance Co., Ltd. * MU Investment Co., Ltd. * Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., Ltd. * Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting * UFIT Co., Ltd. * UFJ Capital Co., Ltd. * UFJ Institute Ltd. * UFJ Bank Canada, (Canada) * UFJ Bank Nederland N.V., (Netherlands) * Sanwa Capital Finance 1 Limited, (Cayman Islands) * Sanwa Capital Finance 2 Limited, (Cayman Islands) * UFJ Capital Finance 1 Limited, (Cayman Islands) * UFJ Capital Finance 2 Limited, (Cayman Islands) * UFJ Capital Finance 3 Limited, (Cayman Islands) * UFJ Capital Finance 4 Limited, (Cayman Islands) * UFJ Preferred Capital 1 Limited, (Cayman Islands) * Tokai Preferred Capital Holdings Inc., (United States) * Tokai Preferred Capital Company L.L.C., (United States) * UFJ Finance Aruba A.E.C., (Aruba) * Tokai Finance (Cura\\xe7ao) N.V., (Netherlands Antilles) * TTB Finance Cayman Limited, (Cayman Islands) * UFJ Investments Asia Limited, (Cayman Islands)  ==Holdings== *The Chukyo Bank, Ltd.

Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.  Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.  Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as a scripting language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Using third-party tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller, Python code can be packaged into standalone executable programs. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems.  CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its alternative implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.  == History == [[Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python]]   Python was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, ''Benevolent Dictator for Life'' (BDFL).  Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features including a full garbage collector and support for Unicode. With this release the development process was changed and became more transparent and community-backed.  Python 3.0 (also called Python 3000 or py3k), a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on 3 December 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have been backported to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6 and 2.7.  == Features and philosophy == Python is a multi-paradigm programming language: object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and there are a number of language features which support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and by magic methods). Many other paradigms are supported using extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.  Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. An important feature of Python is dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.  The design of Python offers only limited support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. The language has map(), reduce() and filter() functions, comprehensions for lists, dictionaries, and sets, as well as generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.  The core philosophy of the language is summarized by the document &quot;PEP 20 (The Zen of Python)&quot;, which includes aphorisms such as:  * Beautiful is better than ugly * Explicit is better than implicit * Simple is better than complex * Complex is better than complicated * Readability counts  Rather than requiring all desired functionality to be built into the language's core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. Python can also be embedded in existing applications that need a programmable interface. This design of a small core language with a large standard library and an easily extensible interpreter was intended by Van Rossum from the very start because of his frustrations with ABC (which espoused the opposite mindset).  While offering choice in coding methodology, the Python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax, such as in Perl, in favor of a sparser, less-cluttered grammar. As Alex Martelli put it: &quot;To describe something as clever is ''not'' considered a compliment in the Python culture.&quot; Python's philosophy rejects the Perl &quot;there is more than one way to do it&quot; approach to language design in favor of &quot;there should be one\\u2014and preferably only one\\u2014obvious way to do it&quot;.  Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and moreover, reject patches to non-critical parts of CPython which would offer a marginal increase in speed at the cost of clarity. When speed is important, Python programmers use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler, or move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C. Cython is also available which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C level API calls into the Python interpreter.  An important goal of the Python developers is making Python fun to use. This is reflected in the origin of the name which comes from Monty Python, and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference materials, for example using spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar.  A common neologism in the Python community is ''pythonic'', which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called ''unpythonic''.  Users and admirers of Python\\u2014most especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced\\u2014are often referred to as ''Pythonists'', ''Pythonistas'', and ''Pythoneers''.  == Syntax and semantics ==   Python is intended to be a highly readable language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, frequently using English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Furthermore Python has a smaller number of syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.  === Indentation ===  Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly braces or keywords, to delimit blocks; a feature also termed the off-side rule. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. It is considered beneficial by Python programmers, but others have criticized it.  === Statements and control flow === Python's statements include (among others):  * The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if). * The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block. * The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true. * The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits. * The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming. * The def statement, which defines a function or method. * The with statement (from Python 2.5), which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing RAII-like behavior. * The pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block. * The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply. * The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function. From Python 2.5, yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines. * The import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. * print() was changed to a function in Python 3.  Python does not support tail-call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's generators. Prior to 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. As of Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and as of Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.  === Expressions === Python expressions are similar to languages such as C and Java:  * Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs (see Mathematics for details). Python also adds the ** operator for exponentiation. * In Python, == compares by value, in contrast to Java, where it compares by reference. (Value comparisons in Java use the equals() method.) Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). Comparisons may be chained, for example a . * Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &amp;&amp;, ||, ! used in Java and C. * Python has a type of expression termed a ''list comprehension''. Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a ''generator expression''. * Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be a single expression. * Conditional expressions in Python are written as x if c else y (different in order of operands from the ?: operator common to many other languages). * Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The parentheses around the tuple are optional in some contexts. Tuples can appear on the left side of an equal sign; hence a statement like x, y = y, x can be used to swap two variables. * Python has a &quot;string format&quot; operator %. This functions analogous to printf format strings in C, e.g. &quot;foo=%s bar=%d&quot; % (&quot;blah&quot;, 2) evaluates to &quot;foo=blah bar=2&quot;. In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. &quot;foo={0} bar={1}&quot;.format(&quot;blah&quot;, 2). * Python has various kinds of string literals: ** Strings delimited by single or double quotation marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quotation marks and double quotation marks function similarly. Both kinds of string use the backslash (\\\\) as an escape character and there is no implicit string interpolation such as &quot;$foo&quot;. ** Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quotation marks. They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby. ** Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. No escape sequences are interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. Compare &quot;@-quoting&quot; in C#. * Python has index and slice expressions on lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the ''start'' index up to, but not including, the ''stop'' index. The third slice parameter, called ''step'' or ''stride'', allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.  In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to some duplication of functionality. For example:  * List comprehensions vs. for-loops * Conditional expressions vs. if blocks * The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.  Statements cannot be a part of an expression and so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is valid C code but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.  === Methods === Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).  === Typing === Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.  Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes themselves are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.  Prior to version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: &quot;old-style&quot; and &quot;new-style&quot;. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0, making all classes new-style. In versions between 2.2 and 3.0, both kinds of classes could be used. The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type).  {| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; |+ Summary of Python 3's built-in types |- !

It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**.5 == 3.0.  The behavior of division has changed significantly over time.  * Python 2.1 and earlier use the C division behavior. The / operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards 0, e.g. 7 / 3 == 2 and -7 / 3 == -2. * Python 2.2 changes integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. 7 / 3 == 2 and -7 / 3 == -3. The  floor division // operator is introduced. So 7 // 3 == 2, -7 // 3 == -3, 7.5 // 3 == 2.0 and -7.5 // 3 == -3.0. Adding from future import __division__ causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next). * Python 3.0 changes / to always be floating point division. In Python terms, the pre-3.0 / is &quot;classic division&quot;, the 3.0 / is &quot;real division&quot;, and // is &quot;floor division&quot;.  Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation (a+b) // b == a // b + 1 is always true. It also means that the equation  b * (a // b) + a % b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a % b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0,''b''), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (''b'',0] when b is negative.  Python provides a round function for rounding floats to integers. Versions before 3 use round-away-from-zero: round(0.5) is 1.0, round(-0.5) is \\u22121.0. Python 3 uses round-to-even: round(1.5) is 2.0, round(2.5) is 2.0. The Decimal type/class in module decimal (since version 2.4) provides exact numerical representation and several rounding modes.  Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general usage in mathematics. For example, the expression a  tests whether a is less than b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a , resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.  Due to Python's extensive mathematics library, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in small-scale problems such as data processing and manipulation.  == Libraries == Python has a large standard library, commonly cited as one of Python's greatest strengths, providing tools suited to many tasks. This is deliberate and has been described as a &quot;batteries included&quot; Python philosophy. For Internet-facing applications, a large number of standard formats and protocols (such as MIME and HTTP) are supported. Modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and doing unit testing are also included.  Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the WSGI implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333), but the majority of the modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suite (if supplied). However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, there are only a few modules that must be altered or completely rewritten by alternative implementations.  The standard library is not essential to run Python or embed Python within an application. Blender 2.49 for instance omits most of the standard library.  As of January 2014, the Python Package Index, the official repository of third-party software for Python, contains more than 38,000 packages covering a wide range of functionality, including:  * graphical user interface, web framework, multimedia, databases, networking and communications * test frameworks, documentation tools, system administration * scientific computing, text processing, image processing  == Development environments == : ''See also List of integrated development environments for Python'' Most Python implementations (including CPython) can function as a command line interpreter, for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives the results immediately. In short, Python acts as a shell.  Other shells add capabilities beyond those in the basic interpreter, including IDLE and IPython. While generally following the visual style of the Python shell, they implement features like auto-completion, retention of session state, and syntax highlighting.  In addition to standard desktop Python IDEs (integrated development environments), there are also browser-based IDEs, Sage (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs), and a browser-based IDE and hosting environment, PythonAnywhere.  == Implementations ==   The main Python implementation, named ''CPython'', is written in C meeting the C89 standard. It compiles Python programs into intermediate bytecode, which is executed by the virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and Python. It is available in versions for many platforms, including Microsoft Windows and most modern Unix-like systems. CPython was intended from almost its very conception to be cross-platform.  PyPy is a fast, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7. Its just-in-time compiler brings a significant speed improvement over CPython. A version taking advantage of multi-core processors using software transactional memory is being created.  Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads; it does not use the C memory stack, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version.  Other just-in-time compilers have been developed in the past, but are now unsupported:  * Google started a project called Unladen Swallow in 2009 with the aims of increasing the speed of the Python interpreter by 5 times by using the LLVM and improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores. Later the project lost Google's backing and its main developers. , the modified interpreter was about 2 times faster than CPython. * Psyco is a specialising just in time compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The produced code is specialised for certain data types and is faster than standard Python code.  In 2005 Nokia released a Python interpreter for the Series 60 mobile phones called PyS60. It includes many of the modules from the CPython implementations and some additional modules for integration with the Symbian operating system. This project has been kept up to date to run on all variants of the S60 platform and there are several third party modules available. The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, with the feature that programs can be both written and run on the device itself.  There are several compilers to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language:  * Jython compiles into Java byte code, which can then be executed by every Java Virtual Machine implementation. This also enables the use of Java class library functions from the Python program. * IronPython follows a similar approach in order to run Python programs on the .NET Common Language Runtime. * The RPython language can be compiled to C, Java bytecode or Common Intermediate Language, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python; * Pyjamas compiles Python to JavaScript; * Shed Skin compiles Python to C++; * Cython and Pyrex compile to C.  == Development == Python's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process. The PEP process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community and by Van Rossum, the Python project's BDFL.  Enhancement of the language goes along with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for discussion about the language's development; specific issues are discussed in the Roundup bug tracker maintained at python.org. Development takes place on a self-hosted source code repository running Mercurial.  CPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:  * Backwards-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and must be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently\\u2014for example, version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. * Major or &quot;feature&quot; releases, which are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. These releases are scheduled to occur roughly every 18 months, and each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release. * Bugfix releases, which introduce no new features but fix bugs. The third and final part of the version number is incremented. These releases are made whenever a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release, or roughly every 3 months. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in bugfix releases.  A number of alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before the final release is made. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, this is often pushed back if the code is not ready. The development team monitor the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development, and using the BuildBot continuous integration system.  The community of Python developers has also contributed over 38,000 software modules (as of January 2014) to the Python Package Index (called pypi), the official repository of third-party libraries for Python.  The major academic conference on Python is named PyCon. There are special mentoring programmes like the Pyladies.  == Naming == Python's name is derived from the television series ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'', and it is common to use Monty Python references in example code. For example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are ''spam'' and ''eggs'', instead of the traditional ''foo'' and ''bar''.  The prefix ''Py-'' is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of SDL to Python (commonly used to create games); PyS60, an implementation for the Symbian S60 operating system; PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK, respectively, to Python; and PyPy, a Python implementation written in Python.  == Use ==   Since 2008, Python has consistently ranked in the top eight most popular programming languages as measured by the TIOBE Programming Community Index. It is the third most popular language whose grammatical syntax is not predominantly based on C, e.g. C++, C#, Objective-C, Java. Python does borrow heavily, however, from the expression and statement syntax of C, making it easier for programmers to transition between languages.  An empirical study found that, for a programming problem involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, scripting languages such as Python were more productive than conventional languages such as C and Java.  Memory consumption was often &quot;better than Java and not much worse than C or C++&quot;. Large organizations that make use of Python include Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, and some smaller ones like ILM, and ITA.  Python is used as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache web server. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has been developed to facilitate these applications. Web application frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjamas and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used for example by Dropbox.  Libraries like NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow Python to be used effectively in scientific computing, with specialized libraries such as BioPython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. Sage is a mathematical software with a &quot;notebook&quot; programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus.  Python has been successfully embedded in a number of software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, and 2D imaging programs like GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri is now promoting Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has even been used in several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.  Python has also been used in artificial intelligence tasks. Thanks to being a scripting language with module architecture, syntax simplicity and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing tasks.  For many operating systems, Python is a standard component; it ships with most Linux distributions, AmigaOS 4, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and OS X, and can be used from the terminal. A number of Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage. Pardus uses it for administration and during system boot.  Python has also seen extensive use in the information security industry, including exploit development.  Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, now developed at Sugar Labs, is written in Python.  The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its principal user programming language.  LibreOffice included Python and intends to replace Java with Python. Python Scripting Provider is a core feature since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.  == Impact == Python's design and philosophy have influenced several programming languages, including:  * Boo uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model. However, Boo uses static typing and is closely integrated with the .NET Framework. * Cobra uses indentation and a similar syntax. Cobra's &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; document lists Python first among languages that influenced it. However, Cobra directly supports design-by-contract, unit tests and optional static typing. * ECMAScript borrowed iterators, generators, and list comprehensions from Python. * Go is described as incorporating the &quot;development speed of working in a dynamic language like Python&quot;. * Groovy was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to Java. * OCaml has an optional syntax, called twt (The Whitespace Thing), inspired by Python and Haskell. * Ruby's creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, has said: &quot;I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That's why I decided to design my own language.&quot; * CoffeeScript is a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript; it has Python inspired syntax.  Python's development practices have also been emulated by other languages. The practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language (in Python's case, a PEP) is also used in Tcl and Erlang because of Python's influence.  Python has been awarded a TIOBE Programming Language of the Year award twice (in 2007 and 2010), which is given to the language with the greatest growth in popularity over the course of a year, as measured by the TIOBE index.  \""

It is intended to let application developers &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode (class file) that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. Java is, as of 2014, one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since merged into Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.  The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were developed by Sun from 1991 and first released in 1995. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).  ==History==   Duke, the Java mascot James Gosling, Mike Sheridan,  and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.Object-oriented programming  The language was initially called ''Oak'' after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office; it went by the name ''Green'' later, and was later renamed ''Java'', from Java coffee,&quot;[ So why did they decide to call it Java?]&quot;, Kieron Murphy, JavaWorld.com, 10/04/96 said to be consumed in large quantities by the language's creators. Gosling aimed to implement a virtual machine and a language that had a familiar C/C++ style of notation.Kabutz, Heinz; [ ''Once Upon an Oak'']. Artima. Retrieved April 29, 2007.  Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised &quot;Write Once, Run Anywhere&quot; (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run ''Java applets'' within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. With the advent of ''Java 2'' (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 \\u2013 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. For example, ''J2EE'' targeted enterprise applications and the greatly stripped-down version ''J2ME'' for mobile applications (Mobile Java). ''J2SE'' designated the Standard Edition. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new ''J2'' versions as ''Java EE'', ''Java ME'', and ''Java SE'', respectively.  In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.[ Java Study Group]; [ Why Java Was \\u2013 Not \\u2013 Standardized Twice]; [ What is ECMA\\u2014and why Microsoft cares] Java remains a ''de facto'' standard, controlled through the Java Community Process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System. Sun distinguishes between its Software Development Kit (SDK) and Runtime Environment (JRE) (a subset of the SDK); the primary distinction involves the JRE's lack of the compiler, utility programs, and header files.  On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of Java as free and open source software, (FOSS), under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Java's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.  Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regards to Java was as an &quot;evangelist.&quot; Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009\\u20132010, Oracle has described itself as the &quot;steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency&quot;. This did not hold Oracle, however, from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK (see Google section below). Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers. There are 930 million Java Runtime Environment downloads each year and 3 billion mobile phones run Java. On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.  ===Principles=== [[James Gosling, the creator of Java]] There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:  # It should be &quot;simple, object-oriented and familiar&quot; # It should be &quot;robust and secure&quot; # It should be &quot;architecture-neutral and portable&quot; # It should execute with &quot;high performance&quot; # It should be &quot;interpreted, threaded, and dynamic&quot;   ===Versions===  Major release versions of Java, along with their release dates: * JDK 1.0 (January 21, 1996) * JDK 1.1 (February 19, 1997) * J2SE 1.2 (December 8, 1998) * J2SE 1.3 (May 8, 2000) * J2SE 1.4 (February 6, 2002) * J2SE 5.0 (September 30, 2004) * Java SE 6 (December 11, 2006) * Java SE 7 (July 28, 2011) * Java SE 8 (March 18, 2014)  ==Practices==  ===Java platform===    One characteristic of Java is portability, which means that computer programs written in the Java language must run similarly on any hardware/operating-system platform. This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to platform-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be interpreted by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. End-users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their own machine for standalone Java applications, or in a Web browser for Java applets.  Standardized libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and networking.  A major benefit of using bytecode is porting. However, the overhead of interpretation means that interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than programs compiled to native executables would. Just-in-Time (JIT) compilers were introduced from an early stage that compile bytecodes to machine code during runtime.  ====Implementations====   Oracle Corporation is the current owner of the official implementation of the Java SE platform, following their acquisition of Sun Microsystems on  January 27, 2010. This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun. The Oracle implementation is available for Mac OS X, Windows and Solaris. Because Java lacks any formal standardization recognized by Ecma International, ISO/IEC, ANSI, or other third-party standards organization, the Oracle implementation is the de facto standard.  The Oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which contains the parts of the Java SE platform required to run Java programs and is intended for end-users, and the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the Java compiler, Javadoc, Jar, and a debugger.  OpenJDK is another notable Java SE implementation that is licensed under the GPL. The implementation started when Sun began releasing the Java source code under the GPL. As of Java SE 7, OpenJDK is the official Java reference implementation.  The goal of Java is to make all implementations of Java compatible. Historically, Sun's trademark license for usage of the Java brand insists that all implementations be &quot;compatible&quot;. This resulted in a legal dispute with Microsoft after Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support RMI or JNI and had added platform-specific features of their own. Sun sued in 1997, and in 2001 won a settlement of US$20 million, as well as a court order enforcing the terms of the license from Sun. As a result, Microsoft no longer ships Windows with Java.  Platform-independent Java is essential to Java EE, and an even more rigorous validation is required to certify an implementation. This environment enables portable server-side applications.  ====Performance====   Programs written in Java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in C++. However, Java programs' execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of Just-in-time compilation in 1997/1998 for Java 1.1, the addition of language features supporting better code analysis (such as inner classes, the StringBuilder class, optional assertions, etc.), and optimizations in the Java virtual machine itself, such as HotSpot becoming the default for Sun's JVM in 2000.  --&gt;  Some platforms offer direct hardware support for Java; there are microcontrollers that can run Java in hardware instead of a software Java virtual machine, and ARM based processors can have hardware support for executing Java bytecode through their Jazelle option.  ===Automatic memory management=== Java uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory in the object lifecycle. The programmer determines when objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use. Once no references to an object remain, the unreachable memory becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector. Something similar to a memory leak may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use. If methods for a nonexistent object are called, a &quot;null pointer exception&quot; is thrown.  One of the ideas behind Java's automatic memory management model is that programmers can be spared the burden of having to perform manual memory management. In some languages, memory for the creation of objects is implicitly allocated on the stack, or explicitly allocated and deallocated from the heap. In the latter case the responsibility of managing memory resides with the programmer. If the program does not deallocate an object, a memory leak occurs. If the program attempts to access or deallocate memory that has already been deallocated, the result is undefined and difficult to predict, and the program is likely to become unstable and/or crash. This can be partially remedied by the use of smart pointers, but these add overhead and complexity. Note that garbage collection does not prevent &quot;logical&quot; memory leaks, i.e. those where the memory is still referenced but never used.  Garbage collection may happen at any time. Ideally, it will occur when a program is idle. It is guaranteed to be triggered if there is insufficient free memory on the heap to allocate a new object; this can cause a program to stall momentarily. Explicit memory management is not possible in Java.  Java does not support C/C++ style pointer arithmetic, where object addresses and unsigned integers (usually long integers) can be used interchangeably. This allows the garbage collector to relocate referenced objects and ensures type safety and security.  As in C++ and some other object-oriented languages, variables of Java's primitive data types are not objects. Values of primitive types are either stored directly in fields (for objects) or on the stack (for methods) rather than on the heap, as is commonly true for objects (but see escape analysis). This was a conscious decision by Java's designers for performance reasons. Because of this, Java was not considered to be a pure object-oriented programming language. However, as of Java 5.0, autoboxing enables programmers to proceed as if primitive types were instances of their wrapper class.  Java contains multiple types of garbage collectors. By default, HotSpot uses the concurrent mark sweep collector, also known as the CMS garbage collector or CMS. However, there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used to manage the heap. For 90% of applications in Java, the CMS garbage collector is sufficient. Oracle aims to replace CMS with the Garbage-first collector (G1).  ==Syntax==   The syntax of Java is largely derived from C++. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language. All code is written inside a class, and everything is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types (i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters), which are not classes for performance reasons.  Unlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading or multiple inheritance for ''classes''. This simplifies the language and aids in preventing potential errors and anti-pattern design.  Java uses similar commenting methods to C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with two slashes (//), a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */, and the Javadoc commenting style opened with /** and closed with */. The Javadoc style of commenting allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to compile documentation for the program.  '''Example:'''   // This is an example of a single line comment using two slashes  /* This is an example of a multiple line comment using the slash and asterisk.  This type of comment can be used to hold a lot of information or deactivate  code, but it is very important to remember to close the comment. */  package fibsandlies; import java.util.HashMap;  /**  * This is an example of a Javadoc comment; Javadoc can compile documentation  * from this text. Javadoc must immediately preceed thing being documented.  */ public class FibCalculator extends Fibonacci implements Calculator {     private static HashMap memoized = new HashMap();     static {         memoized.put(1, 1);         memoized.put(2, 1);     }      /** An example of a method written in Java, wrapped in a class.      *  Given a non-negative number FIBINDEX, returns      *  the Nth Fibonacci number, where N equals FIBINDEX.      *  @param fibIndex The index of the Fibonacci number      *  @return The Fibonacci number itself      */     public static int fibonacci(int fibIndex) {         if (memoized.containsKey(fibIndex)) {             return memoized.get(fibIndex);         } else {             int answer = fibonacci(fibIndex - 1) + fibonacci(fibIndex - 2);             memoized.put(fibIndex, answer);             return answer;         }     } }  ==Examples==   ===Hello world=== The traditional Hello world program can be written in Java as:   class HelloWorldApp {     public static void main(String[] args) {         System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;); // Display the string.     } }  To compare this to other programming languages see the list of hello world program examples.  Source files must be named after the public class they contain, appending the suffix .java, for example, HelloWorldApp.java. It must first be compiled into bytecode, using a Java compiler, producing a file named HelloWorldApp.class. Only then can it be executed, or 'launched'. The Java source file may only contain one public class, but it can contain multiple classes with other than public access and any number of public inner classes.  A '''class''' that is not declared '''public''' may be stored in any .java file. The compiler will generate a class file for each class defined in the source file. The name of the class file is the name of the class, with ''.class'' appended. For class file generation, anonymous classes are treated as if their name were the concatenation of the name of their enclosing class, a ''$'', and an integer.  The keyword '''public''' denotes that a method can be called from code in other classes, or that a class may be used by classes outside the class hierarchy. The class hierarchy is related to the name of the directory in which the .java file is located.  The keyword '''static''' in front of a method indicates a static method, which is associated only with the class and not with any specific instance of that class. Only static methods can be invoked without a reference to an object. Static methods cannot access any class members that are not also static.  The keyword '''void''' indicates that the main method does not return any value to the caller. If a Java program is to exit with an error code, it must call System.exit() explicitly.  The method name &quot;main&quot; is not a keyword in the Java language. It is simply the name of the method the Java launcher calls to pass control to the program. Java classes that run in managed environments such as applets and Enterprise JavaBean do not use or need a main() method. A Java program may contain multiple classes that have main methods, which means that the VM needs to be explicitly told which class to launch from.  The main method must accept an array of '''''' objects. By convention, it is referenced as '''args''' although any other legal identifier name can be used. Since Java 5, the main method can also use variable arguments, in the form of public static void main(String... args), allowing the main method to be invoked with an arbitrary number of String arguments. The effect of this alternate declaration is semantically identical (the args parameter is still an array of String objects), but it allows an alternative syntax for creating and passing the array.  The Java launcher launches Java by loading a given class (specified on the command line or as an attribute in a JAR) and starting its public static void main(String[]) method. Stand-alone programs must declare this method explicitly. The String[] args parameter is an array of  objects containing any arguments passed to the class. The parameters to main are often passed by means of a command line.  Printing is part of a Java standard library: The '''''' class defines a public static field called ''''''. The out object is an instance of the  class and provides many methods for printing data to standard out, including '''''' which also appends a new line to the passed string.  The string &quot;Hello, world!&quot; is automatically converted to a String object by the compiler.  ===A more comprehensive example===    // OddEven.java import javax.swing.JOptionPane;  public class OddEven {      private int userInput; // a whole number(&quot;int&quot; means integer)      /**      * This is the constructor method. It gets called when an object of the OddEven type      * is being created.      */     public OddEven() {         /*          * In most Java programs constructors can initialize objects with default values, or create          * other objects that this object might use to perform its functions. In some Java programs, the          * constructor may simply be an empty function if nothing needs to be initialized prior to the          * functioning of the object.

Every instance of the OddEven class has its own copy of the userInput field. The private declaration means that no other class can access (read or write) the userInput field. * '''OddEven()''' is a '''public''' constructor. Constructors have the same name as the enclosing class they are declared in, and unlike a method, have no return type. A constructor is used to initialize an object that is a newly created instance of the class. * The '''calculate()''' method is declared without the static keyword. This means that the method is invoked using a specific instance of the OddEven class. (The reference used to invoke the method is passed as an undeclared parameter of type OddEven named '''this'''.) The method tests the expression userInput % 2 == 0 using the '''if''' keyword to see if the remainder of dividing the userInput field belonging to the instance of the class by two is zero. If this expression is true, then it prints '''Even'''; if this expression is false it prints '''Odd'''. (The calculate method can be equivalently accessed as this.calculate and the userInput field can be equivalently accessed as this.userInput, which both explicitly use the undeclared this parameter.) * '''OddEven number = new OddEven();''' declares a local object reference variable in the main method named number. This variable can hold a reference to an object of type OddEven. The declaration initializes number by first creating an instance of the OddEven class, using the '''new''' keyword and the OddEven() constructor, and then assigning this instance to the variable. * The statement '''number.showDialog();''' calls the calculate method. The instance of OddEven object referenced by the number local variable is used to invoke the method and passed as the undeclared this parameter to the calculate method. * '''userInput = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog(&quot;Please Enter A Number&quot;));''' is a statement that converts the type of '''String''' to the primitive data type '''int''' by using a utility function in the primitive wrapper class '''Integer'''.  ==Special classes==   ===Applet===   Java applets are programs that are embedded in other applications, typically in a Web page displayed in a Web browser.   // Hello.java import javax.swing.JApplet; import java.awt.Graphics;  public class Hello extends JApplet {     public void paintComponent(final Graphics g) {         g.drawString(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;, 65, 95);     } }   The '''import''' statements direct the Java compiler to include the '''''' and '''''' classes in the compilation. The import statement allows these classes to be referenced in the source code using the ''simple class name'' (i.e. JApplet) instead of the ''fully qualified class name'' (i.e. javax.swing.JApplet).  The Hello class '''extends''' (subclasses) the '''JApplet''' (Java Applet) class; the JApplet class provides the framework for the host application to display and control the lifecycle of the applet. The JApplet class is a JComponent (Java Graphical Component) which provides the applet with the capability to display a graphical user interface (GUI) and respond to user events.  The Hello class overrides the '''''' method (additionally indicated with the annotation, supported as of JDK 1.5, Override) inherited from the  superclass to provide the code to display the applet. The paintComponent() method is passed a '''Graphics''' object that contains the graphic context used to display the applet. The paintComponent() method calls the graphic context '''''' method to display the '''&quot;Hello, world!&quot;''' string at a pixel offset of ('''65, 95''') from the upper-left corner in the applet's display.                  Hello World Applet                                     An applet is placed in an HTML document using the '''''' HTML element. The applet tag has three attributes set: '''code=&quot;Hello&quot;''' specifies the name of the JApplet class and '''width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;''' sets the pixel width and height of the applet. Applets may also be embedded in HTML using either the object or embed element, although support for these elements by Web browsers is inconsistent. However, the applet tag is deprecated, so the object tag is preferred where supported.  The host application, typically a Web browser, instantiates the '''Hello''' applet and creates an  for the applet. Once the applet has initialized itself, it is added to the AWT display hierarchy. The paintComponent() method is called by the AWT event dispatching thread whenever the display needs the applet to draw itself.  ===Servlet===   Java Servlet technology provides Web developers with a simple, consistent mechanism for extending the functionality of a Web server and for accessing existing business systems. Servlets are server-side Java EE components that generate responses (typically HTML pages) to requests (typically HTTP requests) from clients. A servlet can almost be thought of as an applet that runs on the server side\\u2014without a face.   // Hello.java import java.io.*; import javax.servlet.*;  public class Hello extends GenericServlet {     public void service(final ServletRequest request, final ServletResponse response)     throws ServletException, IOException {         response.setContentType(&quot;text/html&quot;);         final PrintWriter pw = response.getWriter();         try {             pw.println(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);         } finally {             pw.close();         }     } }   The '''import''' statements direct the Java compiler to include all of the public classes and interfaces from the '''''' and '''''' packages in the compilation.  Packages make Java well suited for large scale applications.  The '''Hello''' class '''extends''' the '''''' class; the GenericServlet class provides the interface for the server to forward requests to the servlet and control the servlet's lifecycle.  The Hello class overrides the '''''' method defined by the  interface to provide the code for the service request handler. The service() method is passed: a '''''' object that contains the request from the client and a '''''' object used to create the response returned to the client. The service() method declares that it '''throws''' the exceptions  and  if a problem prevents it from responding to the request.  The '''''' method in the response object is called to set the MIME content type of the returned data to '''&quot;text/html&quot;'''. The '''''' method in the response returns a '''''' object that is used to write the data that is sent to the client. The '''''' method is called to write the '''&quot;Hello, world!&quot;''' string to the response and then the '''''' method is called to close the print writer, which causes the data that has been written to the stream to be returned to the client.  ===JavaServer Pages===   JavaServer Pages (JSP) are server-side Java EE components that generate responses, typically HTML pages, to HTTP requests from clients. JSPs embed Java code in an HTML page by using the special delimiters  and %&gt;. A JSP is compiled to a Java ''servlet'', a Java application in its own right, the first time it is accessed. After that, the generated servlet creates the response.  ===Swing application===   Swing is a graphical user interface library for the Java SE platform. It is possible to specify a different look and feel through the pluggable look and feel system of Swing. Clones of Windows, GTK+ and Motif are supplied by Sun. Apple also provides an Aqua look and feel for Mac OS X. Where prior implementations of these looks and feels may have been considered lacking, Swing in Java SE 6 addresses this problem by using more native GUI widget drawing routines of the underlying platforms.  This example Swing application creates a single window with &quot;Hello, world!&quot; inside:   // Hello.java (Java SE 5) import javax.swing.*;  public class Hello extends JFrame {     public Hello() {         super(&quot;hello&quot;);         super.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);         super.add(new JLabel(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;));         super.pack();         super.setVisible(true);     }      public static void main(final String[] args) {         new Hello();     } }   The first '''import''' includes all of the public classes and interfaces from the '''''' package.  The '''Hello''' class '''extends''' the '''''' class; the JFrame class implements a window with a title bar and a close control.  The '''Hello()''' constructor initializes the frame by first calling the superclass constructor, passing the parameter &quot;hello&quot;, which is used as the window's title. It then calls the '''''' method inherited from JFrame to set the default operation when the close control on the title bar is selected to '''''' \\u2014 this causes the JFrame to be disposed of when the frame is closed (as opposed to merely hidden), which allows the Java virtual machine to exit and the program to terminate. Next, a '''''' is created for the string '''&quot;Hello, world!&quot;''' and the '''''' method inherited from the  superclass is called to add the label to the frame. The '''''' method inherited from the  superclass is called to size the window and lay out its contents.  The '''main()''' method is called by the Java virtual machine when the program starts. It instantiates a new '''Hello''' frame and causes it to be displayed by calling the '''''' method inherited from the  superclass with the boolean parameter '''true'''. Once the frame is displayed, exiting the main method does not cause the program to terminate because the AWT event dispatching thread remains active until all of the Swing top-level windows have been disposed.  ===Generics===   In 2004, generics were added to the Java language, as part of J2SE 5.0. Prior to the introduction of generics, each variable declaration had to be of a specific type. For container classes, for example, this is a problem because there is no easy way to create a container that accepts only specific types of objects. Either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface, usually Object, or a different container class has to be created for each contained class. Generics allow compile-time type checking without having to create a large number of container classes, each containing almost identical code. In addition to enabling more efficient code, certain runtime exceptions are converted to compile-time errors, a characteristic known as type safety.  ==Criticism==  Criticisms directed at Java include the implementation of generics, speed, the handling of unsigned numbers, the implementation of floating-point arithmetic, and a history of security vulnerabilities in the primary Java VM implementation HotSpot.   ==Use on unofficial software platforms== Java, the programming language, requires the presence of a software platform in order for compiled programs to be executed. One of the official software platforms is the Java SE platform. A very popular unofficial software platform is the Android software platform, which uses a different bytecode language and virtual machine, and is designed for low-memory devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android makes extensive use of Java-related technology]]  ===Google===  Google and Android, Inc. have chosen to use Java as a key pillar in the creation of the Android operating system, an open-source smartphone operating system. Although the Android operating system, built on the Linux kernel, was written largely in C, the Android SDK uses the Java language as the basis for Android applications.  However, Android uses Java only for its syntax, but not its class library. Instead of instantiating classes from the standard Java Class Library, Android provides its own class library which apps are expected to use.  Android apps are compiled through Java bytecode as an intermediate step into Dalvik Executables targeting Android's own Dalvik virtual machine.  Some of the classes in the Dalvik class library resembled their Java counterparts, which became a major point of contention between Sun/Oracle and Google/Android.  On May 7, 2012, a San Francisco jury found that if APIs could be copyrighted, then Google had infringed Oracle's copyrights by the use of Java in Android devices. Oracle's stance in this case had raised questions about the legal status of the use of Java on Android. However, U.S. District Judge William Haskell Alsup ruled on May 31, 2012, that APIs cannot be copyrighted.    ==Class libraries==   * The Java Class Library are the compiled bytecodes of source code developed by the JRE implementor to support application development in Java. Examples of these libraries are: ** The core libraries, which include: *** Many low level, GUI, Integration, Deployment and Tools [ Java Platform Standard Edition 7 Documentation] *** Collection libraries that implement data structures such as lists, dictionaries, trees, sets, queues and double-ended queue, or stacks *** XML Processing (Parsing, Transforming, Validating) libraries *** Security *** Internationalization and localization libraries ** The integration libraries, which allow the application writer to communicate with external systems. These libraries include: *** The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API for database access *** Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) for lookup and discovery *** RMI and CORBA for distributed application development *** JMX for managing and monitoring applications ** User interface libraries, which include: *** The (heavyweight, or native) Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), which provides GUI components, the means for laying out those components and the means for handling events from those components *** The (lightweight) Swing libraries, which are built on AWT but provide (non-native) implementations of the AWT widgetry *** APIs for audio capture, processing, and playback * A platform dependent implementation of the Java virtual machine that is the means by which the bytecodes of the Java libraries and third party applications are executed * Plugins, which enable applets to be run in Web browsers * Java Web Start, which allows Java applications to be efficiently distributed to end-users across the Internet * Licensing and documentation.  ==Documentation==  Javadoc is a comprehensive documentation system, created by Sun Microsystems, used by many Java developers. It provides developers with an organized system for documenting their code. Javadoc comments have an extra asterisk at the beginning, i.e. the tags are /** and */, whereas the normal multi-line comments in Java are set off with the tags /* and */.  ==Editions==     Sun has defined and supports four editions of Java targeting different application environments and segmented many of its APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms. The platforms are: * Java Card for smartcards. * Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) \\u2014 targeting environments with limited resources. * Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) \\u2014 targeting workstation environments. * Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) \\u2014 targeting large distributed enterprise or Internet environments.  The classes in the Java APIs are organized into separate groups called packages. Each package contains a set of related interfaces, classes and exceptions. Refer to the separate platforms for a description of the packages available.  The set of APIs is controlled by Sun Microsystems in cooperation with others through the Java Community Process program. Companies or individuals participating in this process can influence the design and development of the APIs. This process has been a subject of controversy.  Sun also provided an edition called PersonalJava that has been superseded by later, standards-based Java ME configuration-profile pairings.  \""
